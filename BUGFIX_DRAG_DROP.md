# Bug Fix: Drag & Drop Not Showing Nodes + Grid Not Visible

## Issues Found

### Issue 1: Dropped Nodes Not Appearing ❌
**Problem:** When dragging nodes from sidebar and dropping on canvas, the nodes were not visible.

**Root Cause:** ReactFlow's local state was not syncing with Redux state changes. When `addNode()` was dispatched to Redux, the `useNodesState()` hook didn't update because it only initializes with `initialNodes` once.

**Solution:** Added `useEffect` hooks to sync Redux changes to ReactFlow:

```typescript
// Sync Redux nodes to ReactFlow when Redux changes
useEffect(() => {
  setNodes(initialNodes);
}, [initialNodes, setNodes]);

// Sync Redux edges to ReactFlow when Redux changes
useEffect(() => {
  setEdges(initialEdges);
}, [initialEdges, setEdges]);
```

**How It Works Now:**
1. User drags node from sidebar
2. Drop triggers `dispatch(addNode({...}))`
3. Redux state updates with new node
4. `selectAllNodes` selector runs, returns updated node list
5. `initialNodes` memo recomputes
6. `useEffect` detects change and calls `setNodes(initialNodes)`
7. ReactFlow updates and shows the node ✅

### Issue 2: Background Grid Not Visible ❌
**Problem:** The dot grid pattern was too subtle or not showing.

**Root Causes:**
1. Dot size was too small (1px)
2. Gap was too small (16px)
3. Color contrast was insufficient

**Solution:** Increased visibility parameters:

```typescript
<Background
  variant={BackgroundVariant.Dots}
  gap={20}              // Increased from 16
  size={1.5}            // Increased from 1
  color={theme === 'dark' ? '#3a3a3a' : '#d0d0d0'}  // More visible colors
/>
```

**Color Adjustments:**
- **Dark theme**: Changed from `#2a2a2a` → `#3a3a3a` (lighter, more visible)
- **Light theme**: Changed from `#e0e0e0` → `#d0d0d0` (darker, more visible)

## Files Changed

### 1. `src/components/Canvas/PipelineCanvas.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `useEffect` import
- Added two `useEffect` hooks to sync Redux → ReactFlow
- Updated Background component props (gap, size, color)

### 2. `src/components/Canvas/PipelineCanvas.scss`

**Changes:**
- Added `.react-flow__background` styling for explicit background color

## Testing Performed

✅ **Drag node from sidebar** - Node appears on drop
✅ **Multiple nodes** - All nodes render correctly
✅ **Background grid** - Dots are now visible
✅ **Theme switching** - Grid color adapts to theme
✅ **Node dragging** - Works smoothly after drop
✅ **Connections** - Can connect nodes after drop

## How to Verify the Fix

1. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open http://localhost:5173/

3. **Test 1: Drag & Drop**
   - Drag "Data Ingestion" from sidebar
   - Drop anywhere on canvas
   - **Expected:** Node appears immediately with blue icon

4. **Test 2: Multiple Nodes**
   - Drag multiple different node types
   - **Expected:** All nodes appear and are draggable

5. **Test 3: Background Grid**
   - Look at the canvas background
   - **Expected:** See subtle dot pattern (20px spacing)

6. **Test 4: Theme Switch**
   - Click theme toggle button
   - **Expected:** Background dots change color

## Technical Details

### State Flow (Fixed)

```
Before Fix (BROKEN):
├─ Drag from sidebar
├─ Drop on canvas
├─ dispatch(addNode(...))
├─ Redux state updates
├─ initialNodes memo recomputes
└─ ❌ ReactFlow state DOESN'T update (stuck with old state)

After Fix (WORKING):
├─ Drag from sidebar
├─ Drop on canvas
├─ dispatch(addNode(...))
├─ Redux state updates
├─ initialNodes memo recomputes
├─ useEffect detects change
├─ setNodes(initialNodes) called
└─ ✅ ReactFlow re-renders with new node
```

### Why This Pattern Works

**Performance:**
- Dragging nodes on canvas updates ReactFlow's local state only (fast, 60fps)
- Only syncs to Redux on drag end (debounced)

**Consistency:**
- Redux is source of truth
- ReactFlow state is derived from Redux
- useEffect ensures they stay in sync

**Best Practice:**
- Follows ReactFlow documentation
- Unidirectional data flow (Redux → ReactFlow)
- Separation of concerns (local vs global state)

## Background Grid Technical Details

### Why Dots Weren't Visible

The original settings created dots that were:
- Too small (1px) - hard to see on high-DPI screens
- Too close together (16px gap) - created visual noise
- Low contrast colors - blended into background

### Fixed Settings

```typescript
// Before
gap={16}
size={1}
color={theme === 'dark' ? '#2a2a2a' : '#e0e0e0'}

// After
gap={20}              // More spacious
size={1.5}            // Bigger dots
color={theme === 'dark' ? '#3a3a3a' : '#d0d0d0'}  // Better contrast
```

### Visual Comparison

**Before:**
- Dots barely visible
- Cluttered appearance
- Hard to use as alignment guide

**After:**
- Clear dot pattern
- Clean, spacious look
- Useful for aligning nodes

- `src/features/nodes/nodesSelectors.ts` - Selectors

## Prevention

To avoid similar issues in the future:

1. **Always sync derived state** - If ReactFlow state derives from Redux, use `useEffect`
2. **Test with real data** - Don't assume empty state works the same
3. **Verify visibility** - Test UI elements in both themes
4. **Check console** - Look for ReactFlow warnings

## Performance Impact

**Minimal:**
- `useEffect` only runs when Redux state actually changes
- `useMemo` prevents unnecessary recalculations
- Background rendering is GPU-accelerated
- No performance degradation observed
